# Code Description
## Functions
1. `run(message, bot)`:
This is the main function for handling user interactions. It checks if the user has an expense history and either sends them a CSV report of their expenses or informs them to enter data first.
2. `post_category_selection(message, bot)`:
This function handles the selection of an expense category by the user and passes control to the next step to enter the expense amount.
3. `post_amount_input(message, bot)`:
After the user selects a category, this function collects and validates the amount they spent and then stores it.
4. `add_user_record(chat_id, record_to_be_added)`:
This function stores the user's expense record in the program's data store.
  
The code is used to interact with users on a messaging platform, manage their expense data, and provide them with a CSV report of their expenses. It also offers guidance to users who haven't entered any data yet. The code is designed to work with the 'helper' module, which contains functions for reading and storing user data and managing expense categories and amounts.

# How to run this feature?
